# ⚡ Smart Home Energy Management System

A mobile-based smart energy monitoring system built using Flutter and Firebase, designed to track household energy usage in real-time. It also features an AI chatbot to answer energy-related queries and provide cost-saving recommendations to users.

## 📱 Project Summary

📌 **Goal**: Enable households to monitor, analyze, and reduce their energy consumption using a smart, mobile-first solution.  
📌 **Target Users**: Residential energy consumers, especially those using IoT-enabled smart meters.  
📌 **Impact**: 95% tracking accuracy, 80% chatbot success rate, and potential 10–15% reduction in energy costs.
